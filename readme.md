# WiFi Hotspot Manager

A pair of lightweight Bash scripts to quickly turn your Linux machine into a wireless access point using `NetworkManager`. This tool dynamically detects your wireless hardware and allows for both **Open** and **WPA2-Encrypted** connections.

## 🚀 Features
* **Auto-Detection:** Lists only valid WiFi adapters (filtering out virtual P2P interfaces).
* **Dynamic Configuration:** Choose between an open network or a secure WPA2 hotspot.
* **Validation:** Ensures WPA2 passwords meet the minimum 8-character requirement.
* **Clean Management:** Automatically wipes old connection profiles to prevent IP conflicts or configuration bloat.
* **Graceful Teardown:** Dedicated script to stop the hotspot and restore original network settings.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
* **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, Fedora, etc.)
* **Dependencies:** `NetworkManager` (specifically the `nmcli` command-line tool).
* **Hardware:** A WiFi adapter that supports **AP (Access Point) Mode**.

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Make the scripts executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x start_hotspot.sh stop_hotspot.sh
   ```

## 📋 Usage

### Starting the Hotspot
Run the main script with `sudo` privileges:
```bash
sudo ./start_hotspot.sh
```
**Follow the interactive prompts:**
1. Select your wireless adapter from the numbered list.
2. Choose your connection type (**Open** vs **WPA2**).
3. If WPA2 is chosen, enter your password (minimum 8 characters).
4. Enter your desired SSID (the name other devices will see).

### Stopping the Hotspot
To shut down the network and remove the configuration profile:
```bash
sudo ./stop_hotspot.sh
```

## 🔍 Script Details

### `start_hotspot.sh`
This script handles the heavy lifting. It:
* Sets up **IPv4 Sharing** automatically.
* Configures the wireless mode to `ap`.
* Uses `nmcli` to interface directly with the system's network stack.

### `stop_hotspot.sh`
A cleanup utility that:
1.  Deactivates the `OpenHotspot` connection gracefully.
2.  Deletes the connection profile from `NetworkManager`.
3.  Ensures no orphaned hotspot profiles remain in your system settings.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
* **Interface Support:** Not all WiFi adapters support AP mode. If the script fails to activate, check your hardware compatibility using `iw list`.
* **Permissions:** Since the script modifies system network interfaces, `sudo` is required for almost all operations.
